# Shape Canvas Project by Kenny Chiang

The Shape Canvas Project is a Java-based program that demonstrates the modeling of different shapes and a canvas that displays a random assortment of these shapes.

## Overview

The project is organized into several classes, each representing a specific type of shape or the canvas itself. It includes the following key classes:

- `CShape`: Abstract class representing a shape.
- `COval`: Class representing an oval, a type of shape.
- `CCircle`: Class representing a circle, a specific type of oval.
- `CRectangle`: Class representing a rectangle, a type of shape.
- `CSquare`: Class representing a square, a specific type of rectangle.
- `CCanvas`: Class representing a canvas with a list of random shapes.
- `Main`: Main class to instantiate a canvas and display its contents.
